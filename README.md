Computer Networks Innovative Project.

We designed a local Beowulf Cluster between a Laptop running Ubuntu Desktop and a PC running WSL Ubuntu Terminal, to verify the fast processing of it we executed a C++ program on individual nodes and also on shared nodes, and in case of shared nodes it took minimum time to execute the code, hence the cluster is achieved and succesful.
